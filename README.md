# Image Uploader

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This is a simple image uploader application which uploads the device image to the server.
Here, I have used cool an simple packages named http and image_picker for getting image and uploading that to server.
Have a visit.
